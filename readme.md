# ProDuckApp (PDA)

ProDuckApp (PDA) has two meanings:

- Productivity Application
- Professional Duck Application
    - Here, Duck is not bird, but stoop. Just duck down and let this app take some of the overheads of task/time management within an IT organizaiton.
    
I am making this application to solve some of the common problems we at Eastern Enterprise, a software company, but at the same time, keeping it open source so that anyone can use it, if needed.
